                <h2>The brief</h2>
                <p>Ubity is a company providing telephony solutions to small and medium-sized enterprises and currently one of the top 10
                players in Canada.</p>
                <p>One of the most popular tool Ubity offers his customers is the ability to create audio conferences. However, since the
                creation of the company in 2007, no update on this product had been done. My task was to redesign this popular feature.</p>

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <h3>Mapping the user journey</h3>
            <p>To begin this redesign, I started mapping the journey users have to go through before, during and after creating
            conferences. This helped highlight critical parts of their journey and identify users pain points.</p>

            <h3>Evaluating the existing product</h3>
            <p>The existing tool we were offering our client was a simple list presenting the
            customers' audio conferences.</p>
            <p>This view had many UX issues: among them was the fact that conferences that had not yet started would be presented
            alongside conferences that just ended. This issue was confusing many users who would need additional training on our platform.</p>

                <p>Being one of the most used feature of Ubity's offering, our challenge for this redesign was to <strong>make this product as
                    simple to use as possible</strong>. Could we help users create an audio conference <strong>in less than 30 seconds?</strong></p>

            <h3 class="mt-5">1. Creating a conference</h3>
            <p>As stated in our challenge, we wanted our users to be able to create a conference in just a few clicks and in less than 30 seconds. To do so, I decided to limit the conference creation flow to three screens.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Almost 2 years after the redesign, the Ubity audio conferencing tool is still <strong>one of the most popular feature on our platform</strong> and many clients (such as law firms) use it daily to handle their meetings.</p>
            <p>The challenge of this project was to <strong>give our users the tools they needed to handle critical situations that could arise when creating or managing conferences:</strong></p>
