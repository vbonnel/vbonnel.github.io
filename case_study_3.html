                <h2>The brief</h2>
                <p>Ubity is a company providing telephony solutions to small and medium-sized enterprises and currently one of the top 10
                players in Canada. Since the creation of the company in 2007, Ubity offers a self-service web portal called Studio to
                help clients manage their phone system.</p>
                <p>However, for over 10 years, several developers and designers succeeded each other working on Studio, all with their way
                of coding and designing. User interface inconsistencies became more and more apparent to the end-users and a lot of
                frustrations began to emerge, leading to friction within our team. We needed to address these issues and become more
                efficient in the way we were building our front-end user interface.</p>
                <div class="alert alert-warning announcement-brief"><p>In July 2019, Ubity has been acquired by Telus, one of the three largest telecom providers in Canada.</p></div>

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <h3>Planning the refactoring</h3>
            <p>Large companies often have dedicated teams working on the refactoring of their interfaces. Being one half of a two-man
            team working part-time on this project, our first task was to create an action plan that we could realistically achieve.</p>

            <figcaption>To successfully tackle this refactoring, we needed to break it down into smaller tasks</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <section>
            <h3>UI assessment</h3>
            <p>Putting the plan into action, I started to make an inventory of the various layouts and UI components used across the
            interface. The goal was to find recurring patterns of components we could reuse as well as spot major layout
            inconsistencies.</p>

                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p><strong>1. Convince the management:</strong> we needed to showcase the benefits this project would bring the team while guaranteeing that we could tackle it alongside other projects planned in the roadmap.</p>
                <p><strong>2. Develop a white-label ready interface:</strong> several Ubity business partners were using the web portal as a white-label platform. Our solution needed to be easily customizable and maintainable.</p>
                <p><strong>3. Develop best practices:</strong> this project could only be successful if widely used by the development team. How
                could we make sure designers and developers would adopt our guidelines and contribute to it?</p>

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <h3>A framework-based redesign</h3>
            <p>Upon completion of the initial UI assessment, rather than recreate our interface from scratch, we decided to use
            Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework, as the basis of our new UI.</p>
            <p>Each component found in the existing interface was refactored according to Bootstrap and our design guidelines. The
            video below is an extract of the documentation presenting the refactoring of 70+ modals windows.</p>

        </video>
        <section>
            <p>Once refactored, each component of the new UI was then meticulously cataloged in an inventory.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>A white-label ready interface</h3>

        </figure>
        <section>
            <h3>Evangelizing the design system</h3>
            <p>Once the new design system was validated by the team, we wanted to make sure other developers and designers would use it
            regularly. As a result, we made these guidelines accessible by building a documentation website and a user interface
            library.</p>

        <section class="pt-0 border-bottom">
            <h3>Adopting best practices</h3>
            <p>Finally, to limit further inconsistencies, we introduced a methodology where any new UI elements not documented
            in our library would have to be reviewed by the team before being implemented.</p>
            <p>This approach greatly improved the consistency of our interface (<a href="https://gph.is/1bY37z2" target="_blank">and our sanity</a>).</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Since the beginning of the implementation, our new design system has been a <strong>complete success and one of the works I'm
                the proudest of</strong>. Besides bringing consistency across the whole interface, the benefits it brought were manifold:</p>
            <ul class="cs-desc mx-auto mb-0">
                <li>This project helped shift the developer/designer conversation away from minor cosmetics inconsistencies to
                concentrate on the most important one: improving the overall user experience.</li>
                <li>Our documentation website helped developers ship new features faster as we greatly reduced the time spent on code review.</li>
                <li>The design library greatly improved how quickly we could design and iterate ideas.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="alert alert-warning mt-7">
                <h3>Lessons learned</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li class="mb-3">One mistake we initially made was to let our development team use Bootstrap without creating design guidelines. Lots of inconsistency started to emerge as choosing a framework does not mean having a design system in place!
                    </li>
                    <li class="mb-0">Frequent collaboration between designers and developers is the most crucial part behind creating a truly functional design language. It is also a unique opportunity as a team to strengthen bonds between employees.
