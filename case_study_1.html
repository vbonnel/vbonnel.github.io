                <p>Ubity is a company providing telephony solutions to small and medium-sized enterprises and currently one of the top 10
                players in Canada.</p>
                <p>One of the solutions Ubity offers his clients is a call center functionality. It is an essential part of Ubity offering
                and is used daily by hundreds of companies and their teams to improve the user experience of their customers. The

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <h3>Building the personas</h3>
            <p>To approach this redesign, I needed to first represent the operational team structure of our targeted customer: a small to medium-sized call center comprised of 25 to 100 agents.</p>

        <section>
            <p>Diving into the team structure, I represented in detail the several personas likely to collaborate within the call
            center.</p>
            <p>Out of the 4 personas identified during our research, 2 emerged: <strong>Raj (supervisor)</strong> and <strong>Melanie (call center agent)</strong>. Those were our primary users, the one more likely to be found at our targeted customer.</p>

            <p>Looking at the existing call center tool we were offering our clients, It was evident that it was limited in
                terms of functionalities: there was no possibility for a supervisor like Raj to have an <strong>overview of each
                    agent's statuses within the call center</strong>. This greatly reduced his ability to manage the call
                center.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In just a few months and by maintaining regular contact with our clients, we were able to <strong>greatly improve the call
                center solution we offered</strong>.</p>
            <p>The Ubity call center is now <strong>one of the most lucrative features in our offering</strong> and a big part of our product
            roadmap is now directed towards improving it.</p>
            <p>In addition to voice, our next challenge will be to bring our call center text capabilities support (live chat, SMS and
            social media) to create a true multi-channel contact center experience for our customers.</p>

                <h3>Lessons learned</h3>
                <p>Being a small enterprise and looking at competitors with millions in funding, we had to be pragmatic in creating
                    call
                    center features that we could realistically tackle. Although frustrating at times, it forced us to be more
                    efficient and
                    focus on what truly matters.</p>
